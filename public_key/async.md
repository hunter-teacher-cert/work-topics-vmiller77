# BLOWFISH Encryption
https://acodez.in/data-encryption-algorithms/#Blowfish_Encryption_Algorithm
* faster than DES and offers better encryption security
* Assymetric
* Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption
* Like TwoFish(block cipher, block size 64 bits, key size between 32 and 448 bits)
* 18 subkeys, 16 rounds
