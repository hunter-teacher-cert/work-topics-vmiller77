Twitter â€” Curated Timelines
Twitter in real-time curates your feed by getting each tweet, giving it a score and then prioritizing the tweets in your feed. It will take your preferences and use this to decide which tweets get what scores in relation to you. I think while this seems great for entertainment, it can distort your view on the world making it harmful. Which a balance of things may be going on, maybe Twitter recognizes that your interact or look at X the most thinking your love X. Maybe you do like X or it angers you, but for some reason you look at tweets with X the most. Then twitter might provide more tweets with X (to help you stay using twitter). Maybe you think you follow a balanced/diverse group of people, but because of what it deems as preference, twitter shoves X in your face more. This can be harmful making you perceive different than reality. Also being sucked into a screen because of preferences in not healthy but profitable to others.
